# Azure LoadBalanced Virtual Machines

I've essentially taken the [reference implementation from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en_us/azure/load_balancer/quickstart_load_balancer_standard_public_template), turned it into Terraform, and adapted it for multi_region/multi_instance configurations.

Have a look at `example.tfvars` for usage.
