# Azure LoadBalanced Virtual Machines

I've essentially taken the [reference implementation from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/quickstart-load-balancer-standard-public-template), turned it into Terraform, and adapted it for multi-region/multi-instance configurations.

Have a look at `example.tfvars` for usage.
